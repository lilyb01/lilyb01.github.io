    hazel and robyn, two rabbit siblings from wintersville, learn about the world and themselves.

    in a way this is my way of learning about myself. i started developing this idea as a little passion project back in high school, and over those years the characters have been shaped and formed eventually settling on what they are now. i think now is the time i begin this webcomic for real

    updates are semi-random, but i'm hoping to have a weekly schedule soon
