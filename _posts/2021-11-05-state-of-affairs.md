for the two people who have kept up with any of my projects, it's been a while huh? it's been about a month since there's been an update to hazel and robyn, which is unfortunately not the first time this has happened. so like, i haven't had the proper time to work on my stuff recently. i've recently started a new job, and while it pays well it's really tiring. i haven't really had the energy to work on anything and it's really starting to bother me. here's what i have to say specifically:

#### hazel and robyn
i'm not sure how i'm going to say this, but my drawing speed is a bit too slow for how much i want to pack into each story. hazel and robyn was invisioned as a cartoon series, and exists as a comic bc that is more attainable and give me more creative control over the project. one thing both comics and cartoons have in common is that they take a *long* time to make. after deciding to develop h&r as a comic, i wanted each page to be more filled, rather than just the 4 panel format it currently is (the 4 panel format was easiest for me since at the time i had barely dipped my toes into comics), but i'm even struggling with the 4 panel format as well!

i know the tone of this is bleak, but i want you to know that hazel and robyn is NOT OVER!!! i have a few pages that i can post after finishing. after that, i'm not sure. i guess the comic will go on hiatus, and i'll just be working on notes for it while i figure out how to keep some energy for doing things when i'm not at work, even if it's just restricted to the weekend.

#### evergreen lament
THIS ONE has been a doozy to work on. with a much simpler and more ameteur-ish, mspaint inspired look to it, you think it would be easy to draw for, but i sometimes actually have a harder time making something that looks right in this style than in the h&r style! unlike h&r, this does not have a specific schedule and it will release chapter by chapter, or so i thought at first. based on my notes, chapter 2 is looking to be quite a bit longer than chapter 1. i still would want to drop a sizable amount of content at one time, but i might have to split the chapter into parts. maybe 30 pages each part, about the same length as ch. 1.

chapter 2 part 1 drops,,, whenever. i can't say for sure due to the same issues i've elaborated on above, but i do hope to release SOMETHING before the year ends. chapter 1 is out and has been out for some time now; if you missed it, you can find it [here](/lament). just be aware that this project has very dark, heavy themes that may be triggering to some readers.

#### project sanctuary
if you noticed a link to this in the sidebar, cool! i can't say much about this yet, but here's to hoping for 2022!

#### the rest
as is said often, there is only so much time in the world. there's only so many hours one lives through. i do this solely because, well, i want to. it's fulfilling to me. if you think this is a waste of time, or that my stuff is "cringe" or whatever, lol i don't care; i don't do this for anyone but myself.

i've also considered opening up a discord server? just because? i don't necessarily want to post the link here yet, so if you know my discord (or if we're mutuals on twitter or whatever social media) just send me a dm if you REALLY want in
